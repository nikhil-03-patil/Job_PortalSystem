Job Search Portal is a web application, which serves jobseekers to find available job
vacancies and Employers to identify eligible job seekers with the prospect of selecting the
most qualified candidates. The only way to select best-qualified candidate is to have a
pool of eligible applicants, which is possible by drawing the interest of individuals in the
market. Job search portals best serve this purpose. E-recruitment has become the standard
means for employers and job seekers to meet their respective objectives. The traditional
methods for recruitment include Job fairs, University career employment services,
Employee referrals, advertising in the newspapers, televisions etc.
With the advancement in technology and growth of internet usage, the e-recruitment has
revolutionized the way organizations hire and candidates search for jobs. With the Online
Job search portals, the recruitment process is speeded up at every stage from job postings,
to receiving applications from candidates, interviewing process. The cost of
searching/posting jobs will be much less compared to the traditional way of advertising.

The existing system for job recruitment includes traditional methods like Employment
agencies, advertising through newspapers, televisions and radios, college fairs etc., which
are too slow and stressful. With the advancement of internet, jobseekers rely on the online
job portals, which makes the job search efficient. Again, most of these are limited to the
web/desktop applications, which requires jobseekers to have a laptop or desktop
connected to internet and is not handy.

2) Features and Functionality
Creating a job portal system using the Java Spring MVC framework provides a robust
foundation for building a scalable and maintainable web application. Here are some essential
features and functionalities that can be implemented in a job portal system using Java Spring
MVC.
